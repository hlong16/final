        <h1>Are Covid Restrictions working?</h1>
        <p class="headerP">Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, each state in the US has decided what plan they were willing to impliment to 
            combat the pandemic. These plans have varied in there level of seriousness. I set out to find if the states that took more serious
            steps did a better job at controlling the pandemic than those that did not. To start I found a <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/states-coronavirus-restrictions/73818" target="_blank">ranking</a> of the states in order from
            most restrictive to least restrictive. This ranking took into account 18 different metrics and returned a score from 1 to 100.
            A higher score indicated less restrictive rules. I then used this ranking along with the covid-19 data from each state to see
            what results I could infer. These are the results of that data analysis...  </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class='headerP'>The bar chart shows the complete picture of the data that I am using. However, the scatter plot allows us to draw the most conclusions.
            the line of best fit was calculated using a linear regression function however I am not sure how accurate it is. I believe it still
            has value as it appears close enough and clearly shows the trend in the data. States will less strict Covid-19 rules have more people 
            infected per 100k people. The only exception to this conclusion is New York. The only possible explanation that I can think of for this 
            anomaly is that they potentially implemented stricter guidelines after the majority of the people got infected.
